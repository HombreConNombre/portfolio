# 🧑‍💻 Personal Portfolio - Iñigo M.

This is my personal portfolio, built with **Python (Flask)** and served as a simple yet elegant presentation of who I am, the technologies I work with, and the latest open source projects I've published on GitHub.

## 🌐 About Me

I'm a passionate and versatile **software developer** focused mainly on **backend technologies**. I love building **scalable, maintainable and efficient systems**, always aiming to write clean code and learn new tools.

- 🔧 Experienced in: `Python`, `Flask`, `Django`, `C++`
- 💻 Linux lover & open source enthusiast

Outside of coding, I enjoy nature walks with my dog, learning new languages, and solving logic puzzles.
